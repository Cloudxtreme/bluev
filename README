This is a Valentine V1 ESP interface based on the ATtiny4131 running at 20Mhz

Baud is 57600 as per spec.

See Downloads for schematic or board info when available.

The pins on the ATtiny4313 are (PDIP/SOIC)

1 Reset (nc/ISP/dW)
2 RXD PD0 - from Bluetooth Module or serial transmit
3 TXD PD1 - to pin 11 ICP1 and V1 Data Line  (and to bluetooth/serial receive via diode)
4 XTAL1 - to 20Mhz resonator or crystal
5 XTAL2 - to 20Mhz resonator or crystal
6 INT0 PD2 nc
7 INT1 PD3 nc
8 PD4 nc
9 PD5 nc
10 GND - to ground

20 VCC - to 5v
19 PB7 nc SCK for ISP
18 PB6 nc MISO for ISP
17 PB5 nc MOSI for ISP
16 PB4 nc
15 PB3 nc
14 PB2 nc
13 PB1 nc
12 PB0 nc
11 ICP1 PD6 - to pin 3 TXD and V1 Data Line (and to bluetooth/serial receive via diode)

The ICP1 is used to create a 57600 baud software UART and to do timing to do the proper framing.

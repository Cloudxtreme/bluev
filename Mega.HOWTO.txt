A modular jack inserted into the accessory port on a V1 power
connection will have the following connections:

Since you will probably be cutting a pre-made cord, I would suggest
you align the end with the colors (you can usually see through the
plug) as green for ground and red for power, which would make data
yellow and audio black.

You will need to connect ground - there is a power header near the
power plug - you can buy a plug or go to the ground on the power
header.  You can connect battery to VIN or PWR_IN or the plug - the
power LED should turn on if you have this right.

The DATA line goes both to pin 49 on the edge opposite the power plug
and to pin 18/TX1 near the adjacent corner.

RX2 and TX2 are now the transparent ports if you want to connect a
bluetooth module or something else.  Note that it will collide with
data from the main port so you should not do anything with the USB
serial port if you are using serial port 2.

The PC Command port now just waits for a return, but eventually it
will be a simple interface where you can use a terminal program to get
information and reconfigure your V1.

You will need the IDE from arduino.cc to compile and flash the
program.  It is available for the PC, Mac, and Linux.

The code for bluevmega.c can be pasted into a sketch (that is what it
calls protrams) and compiled and uploaded by pressing the "play"
button.  Remember to set the COM port and the board type (it should
work with any Mega compatible, but older boards use a 1280, newer ones
use a 2560, so check which one you have.

Once loaded, open a terminal program, set to 57600 baud, and hit
return.  It will do a scan of the bus and dump any interesting
information, then enable alerts and print them.  Note if alerts are
enabled when you restart it might take a few seconds to get some
things (e.g. battery voltage).  There is a "v1 busy message" which is
currently disabled but would show up if this is happening.
